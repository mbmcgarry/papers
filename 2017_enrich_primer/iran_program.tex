\section{Iran's Centrifuge Program}
\label{s_iran}

Iran currently has seven centrifuge designs under development that we know about: the IR-1, IR-2, IR-2m, IR-4, IR-5, IR-6 and IR-8. They are named IR, for Iran, and then a number, which often but doesn’t always correspond with their development order. The simplest and least effective design, the IR-1, is what Iran is able to use under the \gls{JCPOA}. This centrifuge has an effective rotor height of 1.8 meters, a diameter of 10 centimeters and is constructed primarily of aluminum. It can spin at about 335 meters per second and has a projected SWU of just under 1 per year. Iran’s most effective centrifuge design, and the most advanced centrifuge on which it is allowed to do research during the Iran deal, is the IR-8. Little is publically known about its design. A September 2014 \gls{ISIS} report suggests that it is 2.3 meters tall, spins at 550 meters per second and has a projected SWU capacity of 16 per year. Below is a table which compares information on several Iranian centrifuges with similar Pakistani centrifuges that the early Iranian designs were based on\cite{isis_website, glaser_?, tack_?,fars_?).
